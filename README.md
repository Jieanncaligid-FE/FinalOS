# OSfinals

Modernized portfolio & practice apps rebuilt with Vite + React. The UI keeps the original look-and-feel from the static HTML version while gaining component reuse, client routing, and a faster dev workflow.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the printed Vite URL (default `http://localhost:5173`).

## Routes

- `/` – landing page with hero profile
- `/resume` – resume layout
- `/projects` – project gallery + artwork modal
- `/artworks` – extended artwork collection
- `/contact` – contact/social card
- `/calculator` – JS calculator rebuilt in React
- `/cpu` – Round Robin CPU scheduling visualizer

## Production build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview   # optional local preview
```
